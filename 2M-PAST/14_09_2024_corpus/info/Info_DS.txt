9686006 | Klebsiella | Drought | Triticum aestivum | -REF- reported the downregulation of DREB2 in wheat plants exposed to drought stress and inoculated with Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter ludwigii, and Flavobacterium sp. | YES
6987256 | Pantoea alhagi | Salt | Oryza sativa | Supporting this, rice seedlings that were inoculated with Pantoea alhagi NX-11 had a significantly higher K+/Na+ ratio under salt stress than uninoculated seedlings in the NaCl group -REF-, whereas rice seedlings that were inoculated with NX-11eps– exhibited a similar K+/Na+ ratio to seedlings in the control group -REF-. | YES
8076752 | Trichoderma | Drought | Oryza sativa | Besides, the genes involved in photosynthetic pathway, the secondary metabolite pathway genes such as phenylpropanoid, glutathione metabolism, diterpenoid, glyoxylate, nitrogen, cutin, and suberin were also upregulated in Trichoderma harzianum-inoculated drought-stressed IR64 rice cultivar. | YES
8071382 | Rhizophagus intraradices | Drought | Solanum lycopersicum | Rhizophagus intraradices colonization under varied drought stress intensities resulted in increased N and P levels in both onion and tomato plants, wherein the former host plant was able to survive due to less negative water potential. | YES
8708585 | Bacillus velezensis | Heat | Triticum aestivum | Interestingly, under normal conditions, Bacillus velezensis 5113 had practically no effect on the AsA–GSH cycle in wheat but significantly reduced APX activity under heat stress. | YES
8952307 | Pseudomonas syringae | Salt | Brassica oleracea var. italica | Salt, ABA, heat, SA and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 treatments increased the transcriptional levels of BoPROPEPs in broccoli sprouts. | YES
8952307 | Pseudomonas syringae dc3000 | Salt | Brassica oleracea var. italica | Salt, ABA, heat, SA and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 treatments increased the transcriptional levels of BoPROPEPs in broccoli sprouts. | YES
8869415 | Dermacoccus abyssi | Salt | Solanum lycopersicum | However, in tomato inoculated with of Dermacoccus abyssi MT1.1T, proline level was lower than non-inoculated tomato under salt stress. | YES
8082249 | Trichoderma asperellum | Drought | Sugarcane | The nitrogen leaf concentration from sugarcane plants inoculated with Trichoderma asperellum increased by 14% when established under optimal water availability, and 22% under drought stress -REF-. | YES
10139069 | Rhizoglomus irregularis | Drought | Vitis vinifera | The ECM-inoculated regularly watered controls had a significantly higher GB content than the non-mycorrhized oak seedlings controls, which agrees with the previously reported data of the increasing glycine betaine patterns observed in white seedless grapes inoculated with different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi AMF species Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizoglomus irregularis subjected to drought stress -REF-. | YES
10139069 | Funneliformis mosseae | Drought | Vitis vinifera | The ECM-inoculated regularly watered controls had a significantly higher GB content than the non-mycorrhized oak seedlings controls, which agrees with the previously reported data of the increasing glycine betaine patterns observed in white seedless grapes inoculated with different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi AMF species Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizoglomus irregularis subjected to drought stress -REF-. | YES
8071382 | Rhodomonas | Drought | Rhodomonas irregularis | Increased production of strigolactones has been reported in lettuce and tomato plants under drought in the presence of Rhodomonas irregularis, indicating that AMF symbiosis induces striglolactones biosynthesis -REF-. | YES
