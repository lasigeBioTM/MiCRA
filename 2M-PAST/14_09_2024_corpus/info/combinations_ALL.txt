 Therefore, we speculate that the ability of Pantoea alhagi NX-11 to enhance the salt tolerance of rice seedlings is related to the EPSs it produces.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 Together, these results indicate that the EPSs that are secreted by Pantoea alhagi NX-11 can effectively increase the K+/Na+ ratio and remove ROS by increasing the proline content, enhancing the activities of SOD, POD, and CAT, and reducing the MDA content, alleviating the damage caused by salt stress to rice seedlings.
