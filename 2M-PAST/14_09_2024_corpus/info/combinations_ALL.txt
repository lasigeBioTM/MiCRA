Pantoea alhagi + Salt + Oryza sativa --> 14 occurrences
References:
 Therefore, we speculate that the ability of Pantoea alhagi NX-11 to enhance the salt tolerance of rice seedlings is related to the EPSs it produces.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 Together, these results indicate that the EPSs that are secreted by Pantoea alhagi NX-11 can effectively increase the K+/Na+ ratio and remove ROS by increasing the proline content, enhancing the activities of SOD, POD, and CAT, and reducing the MDA content, alleviating the damage caused by salt stress to rice seedlings.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)

 Based on the results of the BLAST search of the NCBI database and PCR analysis, we predict that Pantoea alhagi NX-11 does not secrete ACC deaminase data not shown, indicating that unlike the bacteria examined in previous studies, NX-11 enhances the salt tolerance of rice via an ACC deaminase-independent mechanism.
