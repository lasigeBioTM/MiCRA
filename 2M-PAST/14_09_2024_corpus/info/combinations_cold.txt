 Effect of Bacterial Isolates on Photosynthetic Potential of Plants Under Cold Stress The photosynthetic activity and stomatal conductance measured for wheat plants under cold stress and at regular temperature under four bacterial treatments showed that photosynthesis rate was significantly enhanced in plants treated with Bacillus sp.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780275)
 The inoculated strains CJCL2 and RJGP41 were also able to upregulate the expression levels of genes responsible for producing important plant growth hormones such cytokinin CKX2, auxin ARF, alpha expansin exPA1, and ethylene ERF under cold stress whereas all three Bacillus strains showed up-regulation in the genes of these phytohormones at optimum temperature for wheat growth.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780275)
 The inoculated cold tolerant Bacillus strains also aided in inducing stress response in wheat by regulating abscisic acid, lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation pathways in a beneficial manner.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780275)
 To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report for the alleviation of cold stress in wheat plants by the inoculation of psychrophilic Bacillus spp.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780275)
 Pseudomonas and Bacillus strains are well documented to have positive effect on vigor index and root morphological parameters of seedlings and young plants -REF-, -REF- but in present study we report significant improvement in vigor index and root morphological parameters of wheat seedlings as well as wheat plants under cold stress by the inoculation of psychrophilic Bacillus CJCL2 and RJGP41.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780275)
 The phytohormone i.e., cytokinin, auxin and expansin related genes is also up-regulated by the inoculation of PGPR as reported by -REF- and the ethylene gene is reported to be down-regulated -REF-, The expression pattern also conforms to our results as well But to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report of transcriptional regulation of these phytohormone genes in wheat plants under cold stress induced by inoculated Bacillus strains CJCL2 and RJGP41.
