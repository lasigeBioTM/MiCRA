Pantoea alhagi + Oryza sativa --> 13 occurrences
References:
 Therefore, we speculate that the ability of Pantoea alhagi NX-11 to enhance the salt tolerance of rice seedlings is related to the EPSs it produces.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 Together, these results indicate that the EPSs that are secreted by Pantoea alhagi NX-11 can effectively increase the K+/Na+ ratio and remove ROS by increasing the proline content, enhancing the activities of SOD, POD, and CAT, and reducing the MDA content, alleviating the damage caused by salt stress to rice seedlings.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 These showed that inoculation with Pantoea alhagi NX-11 increased the K+/Na+ ratio and proline content and reduced the MDA content of rice seedlings, counteracting the negative effects of salt stress.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)

 Here, we report for the first time on the effect of the endophyte Pantoea alhagi NX-11 in enhancing salt tolerance in rice Oryza sativa L. ssp.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 Based on the results of the BLAST search of the NCBI database and PCR analysis, we predict that Pantoea alhagi NX-11 does not secrete ACC deaminase data not shown, indicating that unlike the bacteria examined in previous studies, NX-11 enhances the salt tolerance of rice via an ACC deaminase-independent mechanism.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 Conclusion In this study, we isolated the endophytic bacterium Pantoea alhagi NX-11, which produces high levels of EPSs, from the roots of sea rice and found that the inoculation of rice seedlings with this bacterium could effectively alleviate the toxicity of salt stress.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 The EPS-producing endophyte Pantoea alhagi NX-11 mediates salt stress-induced damage in rice by upregulating the proline biosynthesis genes pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase OsP5CS and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase OsP5CR, and downregulating the proline catabolism gene pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase OsP5CDh.

 The endophyte Pantoea alhagi NX-11 secretes EPS enhancing rice shoot and root growth, fresh weight, and chlorophyll-content under salt stress by improving K+/Na+ ratio and osmotic balance and by reducing the salt-induced membrane damage Sun et al.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9213282)
 In the present study, we found that rice seedlings that had been inoculated with Pantoea alhagi NX-11 exhibited significantly higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, POD, and CAT than uninoculated seedlings on the 7th day after salt stress treatment, even though the antioxidant enzyme activities of seedlings in the NaCl group were much higher than those of seedlings growing under normal conditions -REF-.

 In the present study, we found that Pantoea alhagi NX-11 significantly promoted the accumulation of proline in rice seedlings under salt stress -REF-.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 Under salt stress, rice seedlings that had been inoculated with Pantoea alhagi NX-11 had a significantly higher K+/Na+ ratio, higher proline content, and lower MDA content than uninoculated rice seedlings.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987256)
 Supporting this, rice seedlings that were inoculated with Pantoea alhagi NX-11 had a significantly higher K+/Na+ ratio under salt stress than uninoculated seedlings in the NaCl group -REF-, whereas rice seedlings that were inoculated with NX-11epsâ€“ exhibited a similar K+/Na+ ratio to seedlings in the control group -REF-.
