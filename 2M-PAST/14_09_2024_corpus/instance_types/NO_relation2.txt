8184954 | Pseudomonas | drought | wheat | Pantoea and Pseudomonas were more prevalent under rainfed conditions RF comprising 43.8% and 26.8% of isolates, respectively, rather than 12.6% and 9.5% of isolates from drought conditions DT.Figure 1Bacteria isolated from the seeds a of drought tolerant lines DTO and drought susceptible lines DSU and b from wheat under either drought DT and rainfed conditions RF. | NO
9878403 | Azospirillum brasilense | salinity | wheat | Additionally, Azospirillum brasilense adhesion to the roots of maize and wheat was diminished by high salinity. | NO

10012461 | Lysobacter | drought | Panicum | -REF- found that under drought the slower growing genotype of Panicum milianceaum L., just like the slower growing Stirling in this study, harboured more Lysobacter Xanthomonadales at flowering, indicating a potential role of some Xanthomonadales in stress-induced growth delay. | NO
11361983 | Proteobacteria | high temperature | Phalaenopsis aphrodite | 3.3         Effects of high temperature stress on the endophytic bacterial community in the root system of Phalaenopsis aphrodite          As shown in  Figure 3A , at the genus level, Proteobacteria 67.7%, Firmicutes 13.2%, and Firmicutes 13.2% were the top five endophytic bacteria in the root of Phalaenopsis aphrodite. | NO
9878403 | Azospirillum brasilense | salinity | maize | Additionally, Azospirillum brasilense adhesion to the roots of maize and wheat was diminished by high salinity. | NO
